<p>If you couldn't tell by now, through the evolution of Fugglers we have different versions of them. Starting from the OG's to the special editions.</p>

<ol>
	<li>OG "Fugglers"</li>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			These are the originals, the ones Louise McGettrick made herself. They have real human-style denture teeth in them, mismassed limbs, and are what was the start of "Fugglers".
		</p>
	<li>Baby Fuggs</li>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			These are smaller, rounder, softer colored, and have less aggressive faces. They usually come with blankets, bottles, or have little diapers on. You can often find them in Five Below.
		</p>
	<li>Keyrings / Minis</li>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			These are more pocket sized, you can clip them to your bags or your keys. They are some of the more simpler ones, if you may.
		</p>
	<li>Special Editions</li>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
			These usually are the holiday themed ones, the ones with costumes, or the ones that are gold and shiny. Some are store exclusives and only last for a short period of time. These are the ones most collectors are looking for to buy.

</ol>
